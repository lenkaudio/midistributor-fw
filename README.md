# Lenkaudio MIDIstributor: *Open-Source 4x/4x MIDI/USB Interface*

## **Project Status**: 

#### **⚠️ Under Development ⚠️**

The hardware is being tested.

The software is currently a **work in progress**, as basic features are being implemented.

## Hardware Design

You can find the *Lenkaudio MIDIstributor* hardware design files on [OSHWHub](https://oshwlab.com/lenkaudio/lenkaudio_midistributor_v1). 

JLCPCB PCB printing and assembly service is available and *recommended* as the hardware has been *specifically designed* with JLCPCB Economic PCB Assembly service in mind.
